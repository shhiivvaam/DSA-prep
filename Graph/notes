BFS -> for unweighted graphs: Guarantees to find the shortest path

* Total number of edges in a Complete Binary Tree : n*(n-1)/2


NOTE 👍
    * Every Tree is a Graph
    * Every Graph is not a Tree

-> Undirected Graph should not contain any Negative Weighted Edge. If so, then any of the Algorithms won't work, because then it will create a cycle, and the total of the cost(weighted edge added cost) will always increase in negative.
